# Chapter 2
In the previous examples, we used compass coordinates to illustrate vectors.
That approach was intentionally simple, but it is limited to two dimensions:
Direction (cardinality)
Distance traveled
In reality, vectors are not restricted to two or three dimensions. A vector can exist in n dimensions, where n is theoretically infinite.
As the number of dimensions increases, we gain the ability to represent and embed data with greater precision. Higher-dimensional vector spaces allow complex relationships and patterns in data to be captured more effectively.
To embed data into these high-dimensional spaces, we rely on specialized embedding models. In this chapter, we will use Google’s embedding model to generate vector representations of data.
